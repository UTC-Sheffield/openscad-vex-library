# scad-vex-library
This is a library to build vex parts with a 3D printer and openSCAD

I created this becuase I couldn't find exactly anything like it. This 'library' adds some usefull commands for creating parts for the vex robotics kits with a 3D printer. I have a chasis I made for my robotics class as an example. The code isn't perfect, and would be totally open to someone fixing it up a little. Hope this helps someone!
